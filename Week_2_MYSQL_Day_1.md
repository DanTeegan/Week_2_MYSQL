Objectives
1.	Understand database terminology
2.	Build an SQL database
3.	Insert some common data types into the database
4.	List various database tools in common use

What is a database?

It’s a repository where you store the data. This data is stored and divided into tables. It used to store out data in a more organised way. Increases efficiency of drawing information from the database.
“A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways”
SQL is a database management system. Azure studio is a data management tool.

Relational databases 

Me must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of information, so that we can query it.
Common labels used in databases:
1.	First name
2.	Last name
3.	Date of birth
4.	Job profession
5.	Relationship status
6.	Email address

Terminology

Column – Database tables are composed of individual columns corresponding to the attribute of the object
Row – a row consists of one set of attributes corresponding to one instance that a table describes. Also known as Records or Tuples.
Table – A table is a predefined format of rows and columns that define an entity. Also known as a file.
DBMS – A database management system allows a computer to perform database functions of storing, retrieving, adding, deleting and modifying data.
Anything that we want to model is an antity. A table is an entity.
Relationtional databases contain related. The tables should be related.

Primary key 

1.	The primiary key uniqly identifies each record in the table
2.	Most tables should have a primiary key
3.	Each table can have more than one column which is part of its primiary key (Composite key) e.g. Order No + Order line No
4.	It can either be an attibute that is guenteed to be unique (such as national insurance) or it can be generated by the DBMS
5.	The DBMS will enforce the uniqueness of the primary key, not allowing repeated records to exist in the table

Two types of primary key

Simple – A single primary key is given to a unique identifier of the entity, such as Customer ID.
Compound/composite primary key – Combines more than one field to make a unique value, such as Customer ID + Order ID


Primary key contraints

1.	A primary key must always be unique.
2.	Must always have an entry, cannot be blank or null
3.	The value must never change
4.	Each table may have a maximum of one primary key

Foreign key

1.	Natural relationships exist between tables in most database structures foreign keys are used to create solid relationships
2.	Foreign keys ensure that the row of the information in table A corresponds to the correct row of information in Table B
3.	The contraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
4.	It prevents invalid data from being inserted into the froeign key column, because it has to be on of the values contained in the table it points too.
5.	There is no uniqness constraint for foreign keys.
6.	A table can have any number of foreign keys.
7.	A row cannot be delted from the referance table if it is in use via a foreign key.

Composite key

Type of database

Flat-file database

•	Stores everything in one table. Good for small numbers of records related to a single topic.
Relational database 
•	Gives you the ability to separate masses of data into numerous tables.
•	They are linked to each other through the use of keys.

Big data

•	MongoDB, Vertica etc
•	Used for data analytics and buissness inteligence
•	Digital age and internet of things
One to one relationship between 2 tables

Relational databases

One to one

In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table. For example, in a school database, each student has only one student ID, and each student ID is assigned to only one person.

In this example, the key field in each table, Student ID, is designed to contain unique values. In the Students table, the Student ID field is the primary key; in the Contact Info table, the Student ID field is a foreign key.

One to many

In a one-to-many relationship, one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table. For example, each customer can have many sales orders.
A one-to-many relationship looks like this:

In this example the primary key field in the Customers table, Customer ID, is designed to contain unique values. The foreign key field in the Orders table, Customer ID, is designed to allow multiple instances of the same value.
This relationship returns related records when the value in the Customer ID field in the Orders table is the same as the value in the Customer ID field in the Customers table.

Many to many

A many-to-many relationship refers to a relationship between tables in a database when a parent row in one table contains several child rows in the second table, and vice versa. Many-to-many relationships are often tricky to represent. (EXAMPLE: A database used by a school application can be taken as an example. Two of the tables it contains are "Student" and "Subject." In real life, a student will take several subjects simultaneously, while a subject will be studied by several students at a time. This is a many-to-many relationship.)
Junction Table - When you need to establish a many-to-many relationship between two groups, the simplest solution is to use a Junction Table.
A Junction Table (sometimes referred to as a "Bridge Table") is a table that contains references to both groups; bridging them together. (Example: Where there is a many to many relationship you can make a junction table with the primary keys of the tables, then form a junction table. This table then forms a composite primary key.
Candidate Primary key - If there are multiple choices for being a primary key, then all the options are called candidates for being the primary key

Composite primary key

When there are not any candidates to becoming a primary key, you can merge 2 of the columns.
